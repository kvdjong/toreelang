# toreelang

A Brainfuck-like programming language transpiler inspired by the [Toree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1554840/Toree_3D) video game series.

Uses parts of the lyrics from [Sparkle Park (I Wanna Love U) by The Red Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCd4PGffw_o) as Brainfuck commands.

Punctuation is entirely optional.
