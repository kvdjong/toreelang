# toreelang

A Brainfuck-like programming language transpiler inspired by the [Toree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1554840/Toree_3D) video game.

Uses parts of the lyrics from Sparkle Park (I Wanna Love U) by The Red Panda as Brainfuck operators.

Punctuation is optional.
A non-alphabetic character is required after each command.
